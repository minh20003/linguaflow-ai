"""Nodes of the Translation Agent.

Node chain per docs/architecture_diagram.md section 2:
    detect_language -> build_context -> translate -> validate_output
                                                  -> fallback_translate

Every node takes the full ``AgentState`` and returns a dict holding only the
fields it changed; LangGraph merges those partial updates. That convention is
stated here once rather than repeated in each node's docstring.

Hard rule: no node raises. Failures are recorded in ``state["error"]`` and the
graph continues down the fallback path that returns the original text, so an LLM
outage never blocks the chat flow (NFR-02).
