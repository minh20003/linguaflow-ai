"""Summarization logic for on-demand conversation summary (B-03).

Two entry points. `generate_conversation_summary` is one prompt over one
transcript and remains what most conversations get. `generate_long_conversation_summary`
adds a map-reduce stage above `LONG_CONVERSATION_THRESHOLD` messages, because a
single pass over four hundred messages summarises the ends and loses the middle
(ADR-38) - and the assistant is expected to answer over threads of thousands.
