```

Planner-executor rather than ReAct, for the reason ADR-05 already gives for the
Translation Agent, and ADR-40 restates for this one: the flow has a mandatory
human gate, and a gate can only be mandatory if the set of things needing gating
is fixed in code. `plan` emits tool calls, `run_tools` dispatches them through a
registry that is a dict in this repository — not whatever a provider's
function-calling decided to emit — and `produces_proposals` is a property of the
registration rather than of the model's mood.

Multi-step, but bounded. The planner sees what the tools returned and may ask
for more, at most `MAX_REPLANS` times; each round is a model call the person is
waiting through, and a planner that can always ask for one more tool will.

Nothing the assistant does reaches a calendar directly. A tool that would change
one writes an `action_proposals` row instead, so every change goes through the
one gate a detected commitment already goes through — which is also what lets
the person approving *annotate*: correct the time, or say how far ahead they
want to be nudged. A direct write has nothing to annotate; by the time they see
it, it has happened.

Every node takes the full ``AssistantState`` and returns a dict holding only the
fields it changed; LangGraph merges those partial updates. That convention is
stated here once rather than repeated in each node's docstring, matching
`src/agents/nodes/translation.py`.

Hard rule, inherited from the Translation Agent: **no node raises**. A failure is
recorded in ``state["error"]`` and the flow continues to `respond`, which can
still say something useful. An assistant that throws into the request would turn
a bad LLM day into a broken chat feature.

`human_confirm` calls LangGraph's ``interrupt()``, which suspends the run until
the caller resumes it with ``Command(resume=...)``. The suspension itself lives
in the checkpointer and is therefore process-local (ADR-32); what survives a
restart is the `action_proposals` rows the node wrote before suspending, which
carry everything `execute` needs. The graph is the computation, the database is
the truth — the same division the Translation Agent draws.

        Two passes because they answer different questions. The time-ordered
        window is what "what did I miss" needs and is always right about
        recency. Semantic recall is what "what did we decide about the deadline"
        needs, and it reaches past the window into things said weeks ago that no
        limit would have included.

        Goes through `ChatService.get_message_history` for the first pass, which
        applies both the membership check and the visibility filter, so this
        node cannot become a second way into messages that skips either.

        The second pass has **no per-reader filter, and needs none**, which is
        worth stating plainly because it looks like an omission. A chunk may
        gather six messages, so it cannot be filtered per reader after the fact
        — half a chunk is not something retrieval can return. Private messages
        are therefore kept out of `assistant_chunks` entirely at write time
        (`assistant_indexing.load_source_messages` uses `public_only()`), which
        is the same call the translation agent's context window makes and the
        only filter that composes with chunking. Membership is still enforced,
        by the first pass, before this one runs.

        Semantic recall is additive: it is skipped when the user has not granted
        `store_memory`, when nothing is indexed yet, or when the provider is
        down, and in each case the node still returns the recent window.
