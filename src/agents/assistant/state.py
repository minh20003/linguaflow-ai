"""The state the Assistant Agent carries between its nodes.

Separate from the Translation Agent's ``AgentState`` on purpose. The two agents
share infrastructure and nothing else: this one is invoked on request rather
than on every message, it may take seconds rather than milliseconds, and it
produces rows a human then approves instead of text delivered immediately.
Merging the two states would make every translation carry fields it can never
use, and every change to one agent a reason to re-read the other.

None of these keys are part of `docs/CONTRACT.md`. What the client sees is the
`ActionProposalResponse` rows and the reply text, both of which have their own
schemas; the shape in here is free to change without a contract amendment, for
the same reason ADR-16 gives for `telemetry`.
