"""The closed set of things the Assistant Agent is able to do (ADR-40).

A registry rather than `bind_tools`, and the difference is not stylistic. With
function-calling the set of possible actions is whatever the model decides to
emit, so the human gate has to be enforced somewhere downstream and every new
provider is a chance for it to be enforced differently. Here the set is a dict
in code: a plan naming something outside it reaches nothing, and `writes` is a
property of the registration rather than of the model's mood. That is the same
reasoning ADR-05 gives for the translation agent being a state machine instead of
a ReAct loop, and ADR-32 depends on it — the gate can only be mandatory if the
list of things that need gating is fixed.

Three fields carry the safety properties:

- **`consent_scope`** — checked *before* the tool runs, not after. A tool whose
  scope the user has not granted is not offered to the planner at all, so the
  model never proposes an action that will be refused and never has to be told
  why.
- **`writes`** — true for anything that changes something the user would notice
  outside this conversation. Those route through `human_confirm` without
  exception; the planner cannot opt out, because it never sees the flag.
- **`schema`** — arguments are parsed before the call. Every field is somewhere
  a language model can be wrong, and `extra="forbid"` turns an invented
  parameter into a caught error rather than a silently dropped instruction.

Every tool wraps a service that already exists. None of them reimplement logic:
`ActionProposalService` carries the idempotency key and the owner policy,
`CalendarService` carries the reminder defaults and the Google push, and about
thirty tests hold each of those in place.
