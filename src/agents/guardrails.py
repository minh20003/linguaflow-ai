"""Input and output guardrails for the Translation Agent (ADR-12, ADR-13).

Kept out of the node module so each check is unit-testable without compiling a
graph, and so `validate_output` and `fallback_translate` can share one
implementation rather than drifting apart.

Two rules govern how a failing check behaves, and they differ on purpose:

* **Checks with no dependency fail closed.** Length limits and the ISO-code shape
  check are pure arithmetic and string work; when they reject, the caller routes
  into the fallback chain.
* **Checks that depend on a library fail open.** If `langdetect` is missing or
  raises, `detect_language_code` returns None and the caller accepts the
  translation. Failing closed here would push every message onto the secondary
  provider the moment one dependency broke — the opposite of NFR-02.

Nothing in this module raises. That is what lets the nodes keep their own
no-raise guarantee without wrapping every call in try/except.

    """Report whether the model returned source-language text instead of a translation.

    Catches the refusal case this guard exists for — ``"I can't help with that."``
    is 24 characters, well under the length rule's 200-char floor, so it would
    otherwise be delivered to the recipient as though it were the translation —
    along with the model echoing the input untranslated or answering it.

    **The rule deliberately does not ask "is this text in the target language?"**
    langdetect is confidently wrong on the exact register this product targets:
    ``"Hotfix merged, CI green now"`` is reported as Dutch at 0.86, and
    ``"Docker Kubernetes Jenkins CI/CD pipeline"`` as German at 0.9999. Rejecting
    on ``detected != target`` therefore discarded correct translations of
    jargon-dense chat and served the untranslated original instead — the opposite
    of the intended effect. Raising the length gate does not help, because the
    German misfire is 40 characters, and neither does a confidence margin.

    Instead the detector is only ever asked to *agree with a value already
    known*: the source language established by ``detect_language``. A
    misclassification into some unrelated third language now proves nothing and
    changes nothing, while the failure modes above still produce output that
    matches the source. False negatives are the acceptable direction here — a
    missed refusal is one bad message, a false positive silently degrades every
    technical message in the conversation.

    Args:
        translated_text: Candidate translation to check.
        source_language: ISO 639-1 code the message was written in.
        target_language: ISO 639-1 code the translation should be in.

    Returns:
        True only when the text is long enough to judge and its detected
        language matches the source while differing from the target.
