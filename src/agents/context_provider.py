"""Conversation context sources for the Translation Agent.

The agent needs the most recent messages of a conversation to resolve pronouns
and keep the translation coherent across turns (docs/CONTRACT.md section 2,
ADR-01).

The source is abstracted behind the protocol below so this package never imports
`src/database/`. The production implementation reading the `messages` table is
`DatabaseContextProvider` in `src/services/context_provider.py`; it satisfies
this protocol structurally, which keeps the agent reusable on a different schema
or transport.
