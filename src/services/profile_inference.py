"""Work out what a conversation is about and where its members stand.

Runs in the background, never on the request path, and never inside the
translation graph. A message is translated once per bucket, so a graph node
doing this would ask the same question up to four times for one message and get
four answers to reconcile.

The cadence is the whole design (ADR-24). Inference waits until a conversation
has something to go on, repeats only as evidence accumulates, and stops
permanently once it has stopped changing its mind:

* nothing at all below `MIN_MESSAGES_BEFORE_FIRST_RUN` messages;
* first run exactly at that mark;
* again every `MESSAGES_BETWEEN_RUNS` messages after the previous run;
* locked for good once `STABLE_RUNS_BEFORE_LOCK` consecutive runs agree.

Counting messages rather than minutes is deliberate: a conversation nobody has
written in has added no evidence, and re-deciding on a timer would spend quota
to reach the same answer. Locking matters for a different reason — a profile
that keeps moving makes the register visibly change mid-thread, which reads to
the participants as the product being erratic.

Known limitation, recorded in ADR-24: there is no way for a person to correct a
standing, so the lock will hold a wrong conclusion as firmly as a right one.
