"""What the assistant remembers about a person, across conversations.

Distinct from `assistant_chunks`, which is a searchable copy of what was *said*.
This holds what was *learned*: that someone wants a day's notice, owns the
payments area, has a sync every Monday. None of that belongs to a conversation,
which is why `conversation_id` is nullable — a preference stated once in a group
is true everywhere afterwards.

Two rules give the table its shape.

**Nothing is overwritten.** A replacement fact points the old row at itself
through `superseded_by`. Overwriting would collapse "never said anything about
this" and "said otherwise and changed their mind" into the same absence, and the
second is precisely what decides whether to ask again. `agent_consents` keeps
revoked rows for the same reason.

**Everything here lives under `store_memory`.** Not checked in this module: the
tools that call it declare the scope, and `available_tools` filters on it before
the planner ever sees them. Putting the check here too would mean two places
that can disagree about what the permission covers.
