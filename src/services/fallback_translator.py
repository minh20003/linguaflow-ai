"""Secondary translation provider, used when the LLM path fails (ADR-07).

Sits between the LLM and the last-resort behaviour of handing the recipient the
untranslated message: a degraded translation still lets the conversation
continue, which a raw passthrough does not.

Two properties this module must keep:

* **It never raises.** Every failure — package missing, network down, provider
  rate-limited, unsupported language pair — returns ``None``, and the caller
  keeps the original text it already holds (NFR-02).
* **It never blocks the event loop.** ``deep-translator`` is synchronous, so the
  call runs in a worker thread under a timeout. The timeout releases the
  coroutine but cannot kill the thread, which is acceptable because the thread
  only holds one HTTP request.

The provider is Google Translate's public web endpoint, reached through
``deep-translator``. It needs no API key, which is why it suits the MVP, but it
is an unofficial endpoint: treat an outage as expected, not exceptional.
