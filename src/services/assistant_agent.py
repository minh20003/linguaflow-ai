"""Run the Assistant Agent graph, and hold its suspended runs.

The checkpointer is a module-level `InMemorySaver`, which is the right shape for
this deployment rather than a compromise with it. The runtime is single-instance
by construction — `ConnectionManager` keeps sockets in process memory, so a
second replica is already forbidden for a stronger reason (ADR-18) — and on one
process an in-memory checkpoint is coherent: there is no other worker that could
receive the resume for a run suspended here.

What a restart costs is bounded, because the graph is not where the durable
state lives. `human_confirm` suspends only after its proposals are already
`pending_confirmation` rows carrying title, time, timezone and owner. Lose the
suspension and the rows remain; the confirmation endpoint then executes from
them directly. One implementation of the effect (`confirm_proposal`), two places
that trigger it — which is ordinary, not duplication.

ADR-32 records why this beat `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`: that package
brings a second Postgres driver (psycopg) alongside asyncpg and creates four
tables at run time under its own migration ledger, which contradicts ADR-06's
rule that Alembic is the only thing that defines schema.
