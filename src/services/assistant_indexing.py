"""Turning a conversation into rows in `assistant_chunks` (ADR-37, ADR-38).

The write side of the assistant's retrieval. `src/services/chunking.py` decides
*where* the boundaries go and knows nothing about the database; this module reads
the messages, applies one strategy, embeds the result and stores it.

Three properties are worth stating once here rather than at each call site.

**Public messages only.** A chunk can gather six messages, so a per-reader
visibility filter cannot be applied to one after the fact — half a chunk is not
something that can be returned. The alternative to filtering afterwards is
building a different index per reader, which multiplies the embedding cost by the
size of the group to protect a case the assistant does not need: its own private
replies are answers, not source material. So `public_only()` applies here, the
same call the translation agent's context window makes for the same reason.

**One index per (conversation, strategy, embedding model).** All three are in the
key because all three change what a vector means. Re-indexing replaces the rows
for exactly that combination and leaves the others alone, which is what lets five
chunkings of one conversation coexist while a sweep compares them.

**Never partially written.** A conversation is re-indexed inside one transaction:
the old rows go and the new ones arrive together, so a run that dies halfway
leaves the previous index intact rather than a half-built one that retrieves
plausibly and wrongly.
