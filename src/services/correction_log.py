"""Turning one reader's edit into a signal the glossary can be mined from.

`translation_edits` stays what ADR-19 made it: append-only and private to its
author. Mining it directly would quietly revoke that promise, so this module
writes a separate, narrower record — what the machine wrote, what the human
wrote instead, and a few words of context with identifiers stripped — and only
when the author agreed to share it.

The extraction is by rule rather than by a model. It runs while the edit is
being saved, where an API call has no business being, and a wrong extraction
costs nothing: the miner only ever proposes a term several people corrected the
same way, so noise from one bad split never reaches the review queue.
