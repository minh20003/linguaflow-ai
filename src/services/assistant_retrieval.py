"""Finding the pieces of a conversation that answer a question (ADR-37).

Separate from `src/services/semantic_search.py`, which searches
`message_embeddings` for the translation agent. The two are not variants of one
idea. That one runs on the request path under NFR-01 and may spend no network
round trip per message; this one runs when a person has asked the assistant
something and is already waiting on a model, so it can afford a query embedding,
a lexical pass, and a reranking step. It has to: the measured hit@3 of the
message-level index was 22% against a chance baseline of 8.8%
(`sweep-20260822-064517`), and an assistant answering "what did we decide about
the deadline" over two thousand messages needs far better than that.

Four layers, each switchable so `eval/assistant_chunk_sweep.py` can measure what
each one actually contributes rather than assuming:

1. **Query rewrite** — one question becomes two or three. "What did we decide
   about the deadline and who is doing it" is two retrievals wearing one
   sentence, and a single embedding of it lands between both answers.
2. **Hybrid** — vector similarity and lexical matching fused with Reciprocal
   Rank Fusion. They fail in opposite directions: a vector finds a paraphrase
   and misses an exact ticket id, lexical does the reverse.
3. **Rerank** — a cross-encoder reads query and chunk together, which is what a
   bi-encoder structurally cannot do.
4. **Parent expansion** — retrieve with the small chunk, generate from the
   large one.

RRF rather than weighted score blending: cosine distance and `ts_rank` are not
on comparable scales, so any weighting is fitted to one corpus and silently
wrong on the next. RRF uses only the ranks.

Two invariants carried over from `search_similar_messages`, both load-bearing:

- **Scope never widens past one conversation.** Retrieval reaching across
  conversations puts text from a thread the reader was never in front of the
  model — the leak ADR-21 catches on the way out, introduced on the way in.
- **Never raises.** A provider that is down means the assistant falls back to
  the time-ordered window it would have had anyway: a worse answer, not a
  failed request.

On privacy: chunks are built from **public messages only**. A chunk can gather
six messages, so a per-row visibility filter cannot be applied to it after the
fact — half a chunk is not a thing that can be returned. Rather than build one
set of chunks per reader, private messages are kept out of the index entirely,
which is the same call `public_only()` documents for the translation agent's
context window. The assistant's own private replies are not needed here: they
are answers, not source material.
