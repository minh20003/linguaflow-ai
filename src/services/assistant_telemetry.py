"""Recording how each Assistant Agent run ended, for `make metrics` to read.

The only writer to `assistant_attempts`, exactly as `record_attempt` in
`src/services/translation.py` is the only writer to `translation_attempts`.
Keeping that to one function is what lets the table's columns change with what
needs measuring: there is one place to update, and nothing else in the codebase
depends on its shape (ADR-16).

Two properties are load-bearing.

**A row at every exit.** Including the endings that produce nothing — a refused
permission, a question asked back, a run that found nothing to do. Those are the
reason the table exists: "how often does the assistant reach the gate" cannot be
computed from the runs that reached it.

**Never able to fail a run.** Every failure here is logged and swallowed. A
person waiting on an answer must not lose it to a bookkeeping error, which is
the same rule NFR-02 sets for the translation path.
