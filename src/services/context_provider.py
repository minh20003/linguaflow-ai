"""Database-backed conversation context for the Translation Agent (ADR-01).

Lives in the services layer, not in `src/agents/`, so the agent package never
imports `src/database/`. This class satisfies the `ContextProvider` protocol
structurally — the agent depends on the shape, not on this module.

Context lines are read from `messages.original_text`. Per ADR-01 the `messages`
table is the single source of context; there is no separate store to fall out of
sync with it.

Withdrawn messages are excluded. `original_text` survives a withdrawal in the
database, and the API blanks it out on the way to the client
(`src/api/routes.py`, `src/services/chat.py`); the agent has to honour the same
boundary, or a sender who withdrew a message would still see its wording reach
the model — and, through the model, a recipient. **That exclusion applies to
both retrieval paths.** A second way into the same table is a second way for a
withdrawn message to come back, and it would be the harder one to notice.

Since ADR-27 there are two paths. The window of recent messages answers "what
were we just saying", which is what resolves a pronoun. It cannot answer "what
did we decide about the migration", because that was forty messages ago; the
nearest neighbours by meaning can. They are merged into one list in time order,
indistinguishable to the model, because a line's provenance is not something the
translation should reason about.

The second path is off unless `RAG_CONTEXT_ENABLED` is on.
