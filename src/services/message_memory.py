"""Remembering what a message meant, so context can be found by meaning.

`build_context` takes the last three to five messages. That is the right window
for resolving a pronoun and useless for a reference to something agreed forty
messages ago — the reader knows what "the migration we talked about" is, and the
model, given only the last four lines, does not.

This module writes the half that makes the other kind of retrieval possible: one
vector per message, stored beside it. Reading them back is
`DatabaseContextProvider`'s job.

Two things are deliberately true of the write path. It runs in the background,
because it is an API call and the message has already been delivered. And it
only runs when `RAG_CONTEXT_ENABLED` is on — embedding every message of every
conversation for a feature nobody has switched on would spend real quota on
nothing. The consequence, which is the honest cost of that choice: turning the
flag on starts the memory from that moment, and older messages stay invisible to
it until somebody backfills them.

    Two independent reasons to remember a message, either of which suffices:
    `rag_context_enabled` serves the *translation* agent's semantic context
    (ADR-27), while the sender's `store_memory` consent serves the *assistant's*
    long-term memory. Turning the assistant on must not silently switch on RAG
    for translation, and vice versa, so neither is expressed in terms of the
    other. The consent half needs a session, so it is checked in `_store`.
