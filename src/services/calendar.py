"""The personal calendar, and the reminders owed against it.

This is where a confirmed proposal stops being a dead end. Before it,
`status = "confirmed"` was a terminal database state with no consumer: the
human approved something and nothing happened.

Two rules shape everything here. Entries are owner-scoped, always, on read as
well as write — a calendar is the most personal surface in the product, and a
query missing its `user_id` filter would be a silent disclosure rather than an
error. And a Google-backed entry is read-only in this application: editing it
here would fight whatever produced it there, and the loser would be whichever
side synced second.
