"""Embedding factory — selects a provider through the EMBEDDING_PROVIDER setting.

The same arrangement `llm.py` uses, for the same reason: free tiers differ, and
a provider that throttles mid-demo has to be swapped from `.env` rather than
from the code (ADR-25).

pgvector stores the vectors and measures the distance between them; it does not
produce them. The requirement that decides the choice here is multilingual
reach — unless "staging env" and "môi trường stg" land near each other, grouping
corrections by meaning achieves nothing.

Every provider must return vectors of `EMBEDDING_DIM` dimensions, because that
is the width of the columns. Changing provider to one with a different width is
a migration plus a pass to re-embed everything, never a configuration change,
and `embed` refuses rather than writing a vector the column cannot hold.
