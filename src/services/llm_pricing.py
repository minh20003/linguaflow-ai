"""Reference USD pricing for the models `DEFAULT_MODELS` (src/services/llm.py)
can serve, used only to turn the token counts already on `translation_attempts`
into an order-of-magnitude cost estimate for the admin stats screen.

**These figures are not billing-accurate and will drift.** Provider price
sheets change without notice and this table is not fetched from anywhere — it
is a snapshot, entered by hand, of what each model's $ per million input and
output tokens looked like when this file was last touched. Treat a cost shown
from it as "roughly this much", never as an invoice line, and re-check it
against the provider's current pricing page before quoting it to anyone who
will act on the number. A model with no entry here shows no cost at all in the
UI rather than a wrong one — silently defaulting an unpriced model to $0 would
be a worse error than admitting the price is unknown.

A handful of entries below are marked ESTIMATED — a newer model whose price
sheet was not available, priced by carrying forward the closest sibling model's
rate rather than left blank. That is a judgment call to keep the cost screen
useful, not a claim that figure is confirmed; check its comment before relying
on it.

`FALLBACK_MODEL_NAME` (tier 2, ADR-07) is priced at zero with real confidence
rather than left unpriced: `translate_with_secondary_provider` calls the free
`deep-translator` web endpoint, not a metered API, so there is no per-token
bill to estimate.
