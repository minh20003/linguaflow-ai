"""Database-backed source of the audience facts a translation is shaped by.

Satisfies `src/agents/customization.py`'s Protocol structurally rather than by
inheritance, the same arrangement `DatabaseContextProvider` uses: the agent
depends on the shape, this module depends on the schema, and neither imports
the other. That is what keeps the agent runnable against a different store, and
what lets the evaluation harness supply its own without a database at all.

Reads only. The rows come from the background inference that fills
`conversation_profiles`, and this sits on the request path where an extra model
call is not affordable.
