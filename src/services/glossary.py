"""Finding the terms a translation is required to render a fixed way.

The glossary exists for consistency rather than vocabulary. Left alone a model
renders "staging environment" as "môi trường staging" in one message and "môi
trường dàn dựng" in the next, and a reader cannot tell whether the two sentences
are about the same thing.

Lookup is deliberately in two stages. An exact match on the normalised surface
form is free, deterministic and needs no model; only what that misses is worth
an embedding call, and only when `SEMANTIC_GLOSSARY_ENABLED` is on. The second
stage is what catches "staging env" when the entry says "staging environment" —
the variants people actually type — but it is also the stage that can be wrong,
and a wrongly matched term is *forced* into the translation. Hence a
conservative threshold and exact matches winning outright.
