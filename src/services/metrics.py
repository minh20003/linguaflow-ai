"""Aggregation helpers shared by the evaluation harness and the metrics report.

Two kinds of number live here. `percentile` and `group_scores` summarise a list
of scored samples and were written for `eval/run_eval.py`; they moved here so the
metrics report and the stats endpoint can use the same definitions rather than a
second implementation that drifts. `summarize_attempts` reads the
`translation_attempts` table and answers the questions the log exists for: what
share of translations fell back, which model actually served them, and how long
each language pair takes.

Nothing here writes. Nothing here raises on empty input — a report over a fresh
database prints zeroes rather than failing.
