"""Reading the standing a conversation assigns to each of its members.

Two things live here because they answer one question — which bucket does this
reader belong to? — from two sides. `resolve_profiles` looks the standing up,
and `select_for_reader` decides which translation that standing entitles them to
when the exact row is missing.

Nothing here writes. Inference fills `participant_profiles`, and it is a
separate concern that runs in the background; every function below treats an
absent row as `peer` and carries on. That default is load-bearing rather than
defensive: profiles are only inferred once a conversation has enough messages,
so *every* conversation is missing them at first, and a read path that treated
that as an error would fail on the common case.
