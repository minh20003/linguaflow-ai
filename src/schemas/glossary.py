"""Wire shapes for the glossary and its review queue (admin only).

Naming follows the rest of `src/schemas/`: `XxxRequest` for what a client
sends, `XxxResponse` for what it gets back, `XxxSummary` for a nested piece.

What is *not* here is as deliberate as what is. A proposal carries counts and
anonymised snippets and nothing else: no author, no conversation, no message id.
An administrator is barred from reading conversation content
(docs/NewFeature.md, diagram 2), and the way to keep that true is for the DTO to
have nowhere to put it.
