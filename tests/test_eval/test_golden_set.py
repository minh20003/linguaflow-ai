"""Structural checks on the golden set.

Cheap guards against the ways a hand-maintained JSONL file goes wrong: a
duplicated id silently overwrites a scenario, a missing field crashes a run
forty samples in, and a language the system does not support is scored against
a translation the agent was never asked to produce.

Fixtures live in this file rather than tests/conftest.py, which is shared
