"""Tests that a private assistant reply reaches nobody but the person who asked.

`docs/NewFeature.md` §3.3 calls this the easiest place in the design to leak
from, and names the three ways in: reloading history, searching the conversation,
and trusting the frontend to hide what the API already sent. Each has a test
here, and the third is asserted against the compiled SQL rather than the response
body — a filter applied after the rows are fetched passes a body check and still
puts the text on the wire.

Nothing here mocks an LLM: the reply text is written directly, because what is
under test is who can read a row, not what the model put in it.

Fixtures live in this file rather than tests/conftest.py, which is shared across
all feature areas.
