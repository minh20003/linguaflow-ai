"""The Assistant Agent's tool registry (ADR-40).

These assert the properties that make a closed registry safer than
function-calling, and each one is a thing that would fail silently: a write tool
mislabelled as a read skips the human gate; a tool offered without its permission
produces an apology instead of an answer; an argument schema that accepts
anything lets a hallucinated parameter through to a service.

No database. The tools are bound to `None` and never actually run except where a
test replaces the callable, because what is under test here is the registration
and the dispatch, not the services underneath — those have their own tests.
