"""Tests for resolving a reader's standing and the translation it entitles them to.

The fallback ladder in `select_for_reader` is the part worth guarding. Standings
are inferred and can change, while a translation keeps the standing it was
written under forever, so the two drift apart by design. Every step of the
ladder exists to stop that drift from showing a reader nothing at all — and a
regression there fails silently, because "no translation" renders as the
original text, which is also what a genuine translation failure renders as.

Fixtures live in this file rather than tests/conftest.py, which is shared
across all feature areas.
