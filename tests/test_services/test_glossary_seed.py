"""Tests for the starter glossary file itself.

The same reasoning as `tests/test_eval/test_golden_set.py`: this is hand-edited
data that nothing else validates, and every way it can be wrong is quiet. A
duplicate scope fails at seed time with a constraint violation somebody has to
decode; a `keep_verbatim` row whose target differs from its source tells the
prompt two contradictory things at once; an unsupported language produces
entries no lookup will ever match.

Nothing here needs a database, which is the point — this checks the file, not
the loader.
