"""The Assistant Agent's measurement log (ADR-16's arrangement, ADR-40's agent).

Two things are worth holding in place here, and both are the kind that fail
quietly.

`classify` decides which bucket a run lands in, and the buckets are the report:
a run recorded as `empty` when it actually refused makes a permission problem
look like a quiet week. Its ordering is also load-bearing — a run that both
proposed and executed is one run, and counting it twice would make the
confirmation rate exceed one.

`record_attempt` must never be able to fail a run. A person waiting on an answer
must not lose it to a bookkeeping error, which is the rule NFR-02 sets for the
translation path and this inherits.
