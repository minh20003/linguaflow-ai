"""Tests for inferring what a conversation is about and who is in it.

The cadence is what these mostly pin. It is the part with no visible symptom
when it goes wrong: inferring too eagerly spends quota and makes the register
change mid-thread, inferring too rarely leaves translations neutral forever, and
neither shows up as an error. The lock is worth guarding for a harder reason —
it is permanent, and there is no way for a person to undo it (ADR-24).

The model is always faked. Fixtures live in this file rather than
tests/conftest.py, which is shared across all feature areas.
