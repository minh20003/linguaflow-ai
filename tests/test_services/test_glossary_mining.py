"""Tests for turning corrections into glossary proposals.

The thresholds are what these guard, and they are the part with a cost in both
directions. Too low and one person's preference becomes house style for
everybody. Too high and the queue stays empty and the feature looks broken. In
between, the decision is invisible: nothing logs "this term was nearly
proposed".

Nothing here touches a database or a model, which is the point of keeping the
clustering pure.

Fixtures live in this file rather than tests/conftest.py, which is shared
across all feature areas.
