"""The Assistant Agent resolves its own models, never the translation agent's.

These are pure `Settings` tests: no database, no provider package, no network.
The rule they hold in place is small and easy to break by accident — "empty
means inherit, but a model never crosses providers" — and breaking it is silent,
because the wrong model answers perfectly well and only the report is wrong.
