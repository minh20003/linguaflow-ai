"""Tests for choosing which glossary terms a message has to honour.

The scope rules are the point. One source term can hold several entries that
differ only in who is reading, and picking the wrong one does not fail — it
produces a fluent translation using the vocabulary meant for somebody else,
which is the exact confusion the glossary exists to remove.

Fixtures live in this file rather than tests/conftest.py, which is shared
across all feature areas.
