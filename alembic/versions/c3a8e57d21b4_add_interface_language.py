"""add users.interface_language

The language the interface is drawn in, separate from the one messages are
translated into (docs/CONTRACT.md §1.2).

Added in three steps rather than one, because the column is `NOT NULL` and the
table already has rows: create it nullable, fill every row from that account's
own `preferred_language`, then tighten it. Filling from `preferred_language`
rather than from the `en` default is what keeps existing accounts looking
exactly as they did the day before the upgrade.

SQLite cannot ALTER a column, so the tightening step runs inside a batch
operation, which rebuilds the table. That is safe here and nothing else
references `users.interface_language`.
