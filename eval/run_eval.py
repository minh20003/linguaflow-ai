"""Translation quality scoring over the golden set (F-03.3).

Runs the Translation Agent across eval/golden_set.jsonl, scores each sample with
an LLM-as-judge and writes the results to eval/results/report.md.

Usage:
    python eval/run_eval.py                 # run every sample
    python eval/run_eval.py --limit 5       # smoke test on the first 5
    python eval/run_eval.py --no-write      # print only, do not write the report

Requires an LLM provider configured in .env (see LLM_PROVIDER). Scores come from
a model, not from human raters, so they are only comparable between runs.

Each golden-set row carries two classification fields the report breaks results
down by:

* ``chat_type`` — ``direct`` for a bilingual one-to-one thread, ``group`` for a
  thread whose context mixes three or more languages.
* ``context_level`` — ``rich`` when two or more context messages are supplied
  (three or more for group threads), ``poor`` for zero or one. This is the
  supplied-context count, not a judgement about how much context the sentence
  needs.

Three further fields are optional and carried only by the samples that test
them: ``domain`` and ``audience`` say what the conversation is about and who it
is with, and ``honorific_profile`` says where the reader stands. Absent is a
real state rather than a gap — it is what every conversation looks like before
anything has been inferred — so a sample without them exercises exactly the
prompt it always did. Glossary terms are not listed per sample: they are
selected from the shipped ``seed/glossary_en_vi.jsonl`` by the same rule
production uses, so what is scored is the glossary that ships.

Speakers in ``context_messages`` are coded ``U01``, ``U02``, ``U03``, numbered in
order of first appearance within each conversation. They carry no name and no
role, because the real ``ContextProvider`` supplies none — ``context_messages``
is a plain ``list[str]`` per docs/CONTRACT.md section 2. Choosing the right
register and pronouns from the conversation alone is the behaviour under test,
so labelling a speaker as a client or a developer would hand the model the
answer. Scenario intent is documented in each row's ``note`` field, which is
never sent to the model.

The generated report is written in Vietnamese: it is a team deliverable, and
project documentation is Vietnamese by convention (see CLAUDE.md).

- Meaning preserved relative to the original (most important)
- Correct pronouns and recovered subjects given the conversation history above
- Technical terms, proper nouns and figures kept intact
- Addresses the reader as the reference does. Where the target language marks \
standing — Vietnamese pronouns, Japanese keigo, Korean verb endings — using \
the wrong one is a real error, not a stylistic difference
- Renders in-house terms as the reference does. The same word is often left \
alone for a colleague and translated for a client, and the reference shows \
which was wanted here
- Reads naturally in the target language

# Constraints
- The system translation need not match the reference word for word. Different \
wording that carries the same meaning still scores high.
- Return one decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0. No explanation, no other \
characters.\
